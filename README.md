# Retiree Income Projection

## Introduction

This project aims to model a real-life retirement savings plan and cash flow based on the email received from the client on Jan 1st, 2023. The goal is to provide answers to various questions related to retirement finances, taking into account factors such as investment returns, inflation, tax implications, and state residency.

## Client's Email Summary

The client, a recent retiree, expressed concerns about the longevity of their retirement savings and sought assistance in understanding various financial aspects, including:
- Potential risks of running out of money too soon
- Impact of living beyond life expectancy
- Adequacy of savings account before accessing IRA funds
- Optimization of expenses until IRA funds become available
- Consideration of tax implications on IRA withdrawals
- Timing of potential relocation to California for tax benefits

## Approach

- Develop a series of Python functions to model retirement cash flow based on client's inputs and assumptions.
- Calculate retirement income, expenses, investment returns, and tax liabilities over multiple years.
- Incorporate inflation projections and state tax brackets to adjust financial projections accordingly.
- Provide insights and recommendations to address client's concerns and optimize retirement finances.

## Key Functions

1. `calculate_retirement_cashflow`: Calculate retirement cash flow based on income, expenses, investment returns, and inflation.
2. `calculate_tax_liabilities`: Estimate tax liabilities on IRA withdrawals based on applicable tax brackets.
3. `optimize_expenses`: Determine necessary expense adjustments to bridge gap until IRA funds become available.
4. `determine_tax_optimal_state`: Analyze state tax implications and recommend optimal timing for potential relocation.

## Data Sources

- Inflation projections: Provided by the client's tax accountant as an attachment to the email.
- State tax brackets: Provided by the client's tax accountant as an attachment to the email.
- IRA required minimum distributions (RMDs): Obtained from government websites.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Update the necessary inputs and assumptions in the Python script (e.g., income, expenses, investment returns).
3. Run the Python script to calculate retirement cash flow and tax implications.
4. Review the generated insights and recommendations to optimize retirement finances.

## Conclusion

The retiree income projection model developed in Python provides valuable insights into retirement cash flow, tax implications, and financial optimization strategies. By addressing the client's concerns and questions, this project aims to help retirees make informed decisions to secure their financial future.
